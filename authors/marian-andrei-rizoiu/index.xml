&lt;p>Say you are looking for a new job. You head to LinkedIn to spruce up your profile and look around your social network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But who should you reach out to for an introduction to a potential new employer? A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4476">new study&lt;/a> of more than 20 million people, published in Science, shows that your close friends (on LinkedIn) are not your best bet: instead you should look to acquaintances you don't know well enough to share a personal connection with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-strength-of-weak-ties">The strength of weak ties&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In 1973, the American sociologist &lt;a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/mark-granovetter">Mark Granovetter&lt;/a> coined the phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086%2F225469">the strength of weak ties&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; in the context of social networks. He argued that the stronger the ties between two individuals, the more their friendship networks will overlap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply put, you are most likely to know all the friends of a close friend, but few of the friends of an acquaintance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you are searching for a job, you probably already know everything your immediate neighbourhood has to offer. Intuitively, it is the weak ties – your acquaintances – that offer the most opportunities for new discoveries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="weak-ties-and-jobs">Weak ties and jobs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Granovetter's theory feels right, but is it? A team of researchers from LinkedIn, Harvard Business School, Stanford and MIT set out to gather some empirical evidence on how weak ties affect job mobility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their research piggy-backed on the efforts of engineers at LinkedIn to test and improve the platform's &amp;ldquo;People You May Know&amp;rdquo; recommendation algorithm. LinkedIn regularly updates this algorithm, which recommends new people to add to your network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these updates tested the effects of encouraging the formation of strong ties (recommending adding your close friends) versus weak ties (recommending acquaintances and friends of friends). The researchers then followed the users that participated in this &amp;ldquo;A/B testing&amp;rdquo; to see if the difference impacted their employment outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than 20 million LinkedIn users worldwide were randomly assigned to well-defined treatment groups. Users in each group were shown slightly different new contact recommendations, which led users in some groups to form more strong ties and users in other groups to form more weak ties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, the team measured how many jobs users in each group applied for, and how many &amp;ldquo;job transmissions&amp;rdquo; occurred. Job transmissions are of particular interest, as they are defined as getting a job in the same company as the new contact. A job transmission suggests the new contact helped land the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="moderately-weak-ties-are-best">Moderately weak ties are best&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The study uses causal analysis to go beyond simple correlations and connect link formation with employment. There are three important findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the recommender engine significantly shapes link formation. Users who were recommended more weak links formed significantly more weak links, and users who were recommended more strong links formed more strong links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the experiment provides causal evidence that moderately weak ties are more than twice as effective as strong ties in helping a job-seeker join a new employer. What's a &amp;ldquo;moderately&amp;rdquo; weak tie? The study found job transmission is most likely from acquaintances with whom you share about 10 mutual friends and rarely interact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-recommendations">Better recommendations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This LinkedIn study is first to causally prove Granovetter's theory in the employment market. The causal analysis is key here, as large-scale studies of correlations between strength of ties and job transmission have shown strong ties are more beneficial, in what was considered until now a paradox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This study resolves the paradox and again proves the limitations of correlation studies, which do a poor job at disentangling confounding factors and sometimes lead to the wrong conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a practical point of view, the study outlines the best parameters for suggesting new links. It revealed that the connections most helpful in landing a job are your acquaintances, people you meet in professional settings, or friends of friends, rather than your closest friends – people with whom you share about 10 mutual contacts and with whom one is less likely to interact regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These can be translated into algorithmic recommendations, which can make the recommendation engines of professional networks such as LinkedIn even more proficient at helping job-seekers land jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-power-of-black-boxes">The power of black boxes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The public is often wary when large social media companies perform experiments on their users (see &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28051930">Facebook's infamous emotion experiment of 2014&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, could LinkedIn's experiment have harmed its users? In theory, the users in the &amp;ldquo;strong link&amp;rdquo; treatment group might have missed the weak links that could have brought their next job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, all groups had some degree of job mobility – some just a bit more than others. Moreover, since the researchers were observing an engineering experiment, the study itself seems to raise few ethical concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, it is a reminder to ask how much our most intimate professional decisions – such as selecting a new career or workplace – are determined by black-box artificial intelligence algorithms whose workings we cannot see.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Acquaintances beat close friends for job connections, huge LinkedIn study shows</title><link>https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme3_content/linkedin_experiment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.behavioral-ds.science/theme3_content/linkedin_experiment/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="radio-adelaide-breakfast-interview">Radio Adelaide Breakfast interview:&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>‘Fake news’ and broader ‘information disorders’ [6] such as mis- and disinformation have emerged as global issues that threaten to undermine democracy and authentic political communication on social media [1]. Increasingly sophisticated coordination strategies have intensified the scale and scope of the impact that disinformation has on public opinion and democratic trust. Howard et al. [3] found that coordinated disinformation operations are now occurring in 48 countries, and in 2019 the European External Action Service detected and exposed over 1,000 cases of disinformation within the European Union [2]. Whilst disinformation has attracted much scholarly attention, most studies to date have focussed on the diffusion and impact of individual content (e.g. ‘fake news’ articles) and the activity of individual accounts (e.g. bots and trolls).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An emerging problem is to understand message coordination strategies, where content authored and distributed by agents (e.g. Twitter trolls) is governed and scheduled by some unknown principal actor [4]. We know that coordinated promotion (e.g. sharing, liking, retweeting) of ‘fake news’ articles by trolls and social bots can greatly increase and amplify the negative effects of these attempts to sow discord and manipulate public conversations about election candidates and partisan issues such as immigration and climate change. Likewise, it is evident that disinformation campaigns unfold via ‘collaborative work’ that co-opts and cultivates organic systems in order to produce desired effects such as increased polarisation, distrust in news media and confusion of the audience [7]. This makes identifying ‘inauthentic’ versus ‘organic’ activity ever more difficult, as they are intricately enmeshed in real-world disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of inferring the coordinated promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ articles using a novel approach known as Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP; see [5]). We analyse the diffusion of articles from ten major sources of hyperpartisan information and ‘fake news’ within over 16.5 million tweets that linked to content from these sites during July to September 2019. Using HIP, we uncover not only coordination strategies but also the promotion schedules of ‘fake news’ content, where agents (in this case Twitter accounts) are being centrally managed by principals (e.g. state operatives, government officials, etc.) in order to strategically promote ‘fake news’ content and maximise its virality and longevity in the social memory. This paper provides preliminary results from this ongoing research, highlighting the current challenges as well as open problems and gaps for future work.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="panel-rationale">Panel Rationale&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Social media platforms are increasingly forced to address what Facebook now describes as ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ (Gleicher 2018): online influence operations that seek to trick platform algorithms into promoting and recommending ‘problematic information’ (Jack 2017), to mislead the human users of such platforms into accepting and sharing such content, and thereby also to affect broader issue frames and news agendas in mainstream media coverage. Concerns about such coordinated inauthentic behaviour extend earlier fears about the influence of malignant social bots, but also transcend them: drawing on social bots as well as human labour, coordinated inauthentic behaviour is likely to involve a combination of manual and automated activity. This additional human factor also complicates the detection of such coordinated activities, and their distinction from genuine, organic, authentic coordinated actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cross-national and interdisciplinary panel approaches the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour from a number of directions. It outlines novel and innovative detection and analysis approaches for a number of leading social media platforms, and presents their results in the context of domestic and international political debates across several national contexts. Further, it also considers how mainstream journalism might report on and respond to such activities in order to protect news audiences from being affected by coordinated inauthentic behaviours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two papers in this panel focus especially on coordinated inauthentic link-sharing practices. Paper 1 introduces Hawkes Intensity Processes (HIP), a novel technique for inferring the coordinated content promotion schedules of automated social media accounts, and applies this to a major dataset of 16.5 million tweets containing links to ten major sites identified as sources of hyperpartisan content and ‘fake news’. In doing so, it uncovers new networks of inauthentic Twitter actors. Paper 2 investigates similar coordinated link-sharing activity on Facebook in Italy during the 2018 Italian and 2019 European elections. It uncovers evidence for the involvement of dozens of pages, groups, and public profiles in such media manipulation attempts. Paper 3 complements this work by focussing especially on the temporal posting patterns in such coordinated activity. It employs the recurrence plotting technique to identify traces of inauthentic actors’ use of automated scheduling tools in systematically posting content to a network of apparently unrelated pages, focussing here especially on a group of far-right pages on Facebook. Paper 4 examines ten coordinated disinformation campaigns across the globe (e.g., Hong Kong, Russia, USA, Spain and Germany) and identifies important traits that help distinguish between those participating in the disinformation campaign and the regular users they try to imitate. Paper 5, finally, shifts our attention to a core target of such coordinated inauthentic behaviour: the journalists and editors whose perception of current political moods such influence operations often aim to affect. Drawing on a series of in-depth interviews with Danish news workers and related stakeholders, it examines their understanding of and responses to coordinated mis- and disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Collectively, these studies contribute substantially to advancing the methodological toolkit and extending the empirical evidence base for the study of coordinated inauthentic behaviour, while also not losing sight of the stakeholders that such work seeks to support. They offer an independent assessment of the nature and extent of the problem across several leading social media platforms, complementing the platform providers’ own investigations into such activities and identifying possible responses to such concerns for both social and mainstream media actors.&lt;/p>
